\item Almost all spectral sequences arise from bicomplexes.

\item A \textbf{graded module} is an indexed family $M = (M_p)_{p\in \mathbb{Z}}$ of $R$-modules (for some ring $R$). Graded modules $M$ are often denoted by $M_{\bullet}$.

\item 华丽的分割线

\item Every exact couple yields a spectral sequence, and every filtered complex yields an exact couple.

\item If a spectral sequence arises from an exact couple of a complex $C_*$ with canonically bounded filtration it converges to $\lim\limits_{\longrightarrow}D = H_*$ which is the homology of the filtered complex $C_*$.

\item Note that the objects $E^{r+1}$ can be recovered from the $r$th page, but the differentials $d^{r+1}$ cannot and are part of the given structure.

\item A spectral sequence is said to \textit{collapse} at $E^s(s\geq a)$ if $E^s$ consists of only trivial objects outside of a single row or column. In this case we have $E^s \cong E^{\infty}$ (at least for $s \geq 2$).

\item 谱序列是一种构造, 有明确的定义. 那么, 怎样构造出谱序列?
